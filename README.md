# Koober TA

This **TA** intends to build an e-commerce website with different steps of features.

### Description

#### Level 1

We are building an e-commerce website. Our customers can:
  - add articles to a virtual cart
  - checkout the cart contents
  - get it delivered the next day

The customer is charged the sum of the prices of each article in their cart.

Prices are expressed in cents.

#### Level 2

Cost of delivery depends on how much we charged the custormer for their cart’s contents
The more the customer spends, the less they are charged for shipping.
#### Level 3

Some products are discounted because of a deal we made with the supplier.

There are two kinds of discounts:
- a direct cut to the article's price, e.g. get 50€ off your 300€ caviar tin and only pay 250€
- a percentage discount, e.g. get 20% off your 5€ creme fraiche and only pay 4€

### Requirements

##### Using npm
You only need to have **NodeJS** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed on your system.
