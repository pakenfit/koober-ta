# Level 1

We are building an e-commerce website. Our customers can:
  - add articles to a virtual cart

  - get it delivered the next day

The customer is charged the sum of the prices of each article in their cart.

Prices are expressed in cents.

INSTRUCTIONS :
*  Setup typescript project
*  `node index.js` should generate a new file `output.json`
*  `output.json` must be equal to `expected_output.json`

# Level 2

Cost of delivery depends on how much we charged the custormer for their cartâ€™s contents
The more the customer spends, the less they are charged for shipping.
